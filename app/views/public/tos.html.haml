Information Collection and Use
Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or reconfigure a ReunionPong.com account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your team page and in search results.
Additional Information: You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. We may use your contact information to help others find your ReunionPong.com account, including through third-party services and client applications. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.
Other Public Information: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with other users. Most of the information you provide us is information needed to provide Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide private except to other users of the site, for as long as you do not delete it. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public to other users.
Location Information: You may choose to publish your location. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tournaments near your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local tournaments, stories, and suggestions for people to follow.
Links: ReunionPong.com may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. ReunionPong.com may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
Log Data: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications. ReunionPong.com uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.
Your Consent: We share or disclose your information at your direction.
Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect ReunionPong.com’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.
Business Transfers: In the event that ReunionPong.com is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile, public discussion posts, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).
Modifying Your Personal Information
If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with account settings to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.
You can also permanently delete your ReunionPong.com account. If you email ReunionPong@gmail.com, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on ReunionPong.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.
Our Policy Towards Children
Our Services are not directed to persons under 21. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at ReunionPong@gmail.com. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 21. If we become aware that a person under 21 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the individual’s account.
